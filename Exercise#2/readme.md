For this assignment, since I am so busy at work this week, I've found a fun Jupyter notebook from a course I took. It will walk you through building a program that will play a fun little tic tac toe game. If you have anaconda you probably have access to jupyter labs and can get it from the navigator but i would recommend just running: pip install jupyterlab and then run it in cmd prompt with >jupyter lab. Anaconda does provide a better web client but I'm really starting to hate anaconda tbh...

If you would like to download this course, its definitely free to get the course materials and use them as long as you have Git, but the videos that go along with them are only available on Udemy if you purchase it. 
I got it for a good price but you might consider getting it if its still on sale: https://www.udemy.com/complete-python-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview 
The git hub repo for the course is here: https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp 

Good luck!
