Exercise#1 -- Web scraping

THe target for this activity is to scan for URLs(links) in the source code of a webpage. You will have to connect to it and basically 'parse' through it and provide only the http links. Have it print out all of the links for the webpage. Use www.xkcd.com for instance, or you can choose a different one, just make sure it has links. Also with google chrome you can view the source code which will help.

Useful Libraries:
Beautiful Soup (https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
urllib.request (https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html)
re (regular expressions)(https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)

I know this one is a little challenging for a first activity but by going and searching for how to do this you will discover many useful tools and practice your googling of python modules/tools. Good luck!
