# PythonPractice
A repository for Python learning exercises

I will use this repository to post activites and practice exercises. Be sure to view the readme.md on each
activity as it will explain what you need to do. If you have a question about any of the activities,
text me. Also let me know if the comments of your code if an activity is too hard or too easy.
Have fun! -Bryan
